## What is Lumioly?

Lumioly is an intelligent AI news and tools platform that automatically surfaces what matters in the world of artificial intelligence — without you having to hunt for it.

The AI space moves at a relentless pace. New models, tools, research papers, and breakthroughs drop every single day. Lumioly solves the signal-to-noise problem by aggregating live news from the top AI publications and curating a directory of 47+ essential AI tools — all in one clean, editorial-quality interface.

Every tool page comes with an instant AI explanation powered by Google Gemini and an automatically fetched YouTube tutorial, so users go from discovery to understanding in seconds.

**Lumioly is built to run itself.** No manual content updates. No admin babysitting. The news refreshes from live RSS feeds on every page load, and the tools directory is seeded with real, curated data that can be re-seeded with a single command.

## 🗺 Roadmap — What's Next (Phase 2)

These are the planned upgrades that will take Lumioly from a strong Phase 1 to a fully scalable platform:

### 🗄 Supabase Database Migration
Replace SQLite with Supabase (PostgreSQL) for persistent, scalable data storage. This enables the ETL pipeline below and makes Lumioly pitch-ready as a production architecture.

### ⚙️ Automated ETL News Pipeline
Instead of fetching RSS feeds live on every page load, build a background pipeline:
1. **Extract** — Scrape RSS XML from all 5 sources on a schedule
2. **Transform** — Clean, deduplicate, and structure into JSON
3. **Load** — Store in Supabase, auto-updating hourly via cron
4. **Serve** — Pages query the database instead of live feeds (faster, persistent, searchable)

### 🧠 Per-Article AI Summarization
Use Gemini to generate a one-sentence "why this matters" summary for each article during the ETL step. Makes Lumioly feel like an actual intelligent curator rather than a feed aggregator.

### 🔄 Auto-Updating Tools Directory
Pull new tools automatically from Product Hunt API or Futurepedia RSS daily, with AI-generated descriptions. Currently seeded manually with 47 curated tools.

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard
Track which tools and topics users are asking Lumioly AI about. Surfaces trending AI tools and topics automatically.

### 🌐 Public API
Expose a REST API so developers can query Lumioly's curated tool data and AI news programmatically.
